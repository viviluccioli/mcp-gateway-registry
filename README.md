## What is MCP Gateway & Registry?

The **MCP Gateway & Registry** is a unified, enterprise-ready platform that centralizes access to both MCP Servers and AI Agents using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). It serves three core functions:

1. **Unified MCP Server Gateway** – Centralized access point for multiple MCP servers
2. **MCP Servers Registry** – Register, discover, and manage access to MCP servers with unified governance
3. **Agent Registry & A2A Communication Hub** – Agent registration, discovery, governance, and direct agent-to-agent communication through the [A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/)

The platform integrates with external registries such as Anthropic's MCP Registry (and more to come), providing a single control plane for both tool access, agent orchestration, and agent-to-agent communication patterns.

**Why unified?** Instead of managing hundreds of individual MCP server configurations, agent connections, and separate governance systems across your development teams, this platform provides secure, governed access to curated MCP servers and registered agents through a single, unified control plane.

**Transform this chaos:**
```
❌ AI agents require separate connections to each MCP server
❌ Each developer configures VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code individually
❌ Developers must install and manage MCP servers locally
❌ No standard authentication flow for enterprise tools
❌ Scattered API keys and credentials across tools
❌ No visibility into what tools teams are using
❌ Security risks from unmanaged tool sprawl
❌ No dynamic tool discovery for autonomous agents
❌ No curated tool catalog for multi-tenant environments
❌ A2A provides agent cards but no way for agents to discover other agents
❌ Maintaining separate MCP server and agent registries is a non-starter for governance
❌ Impossible to maintain unified policies across server and agent access
```

**Into this organized approach:**
```
✅ AI agents connect to one gateway, access multiple MCP servers
✅ Single configuration point for VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code
✅ Central IT manages cloud-hosted MCP infrastructure via streamable HTTP
✅ Developers use standard OAuth 2LO/3LO flows for enterprise MCP servers
✅ Centralized credential management with secure vault integration
✅ Complete visibility and audit trail for all tool usage
✅ Enterprise-grade security with governed tool access
✅ Dynamic tool discovery and invocation for autonomous workflows
✅ Registry provides discoverable, curated MCP servers for multi-tenant use
✅ Agents can discover and communicate with other agents through unified Agent Registry
✅ Single control plane for both MCP servers and agent governance
✅ Unified policies and audit trails for both server and agent access
```

> **Note on Agent-to-Agent Communication:** AI Agents discover other AI Agents through the unified Agent Registry and communicate with them **directly** (peer-to-peer) without routing through the MCP Gateway. The Registry handles discovery, authentication, and access control, while agents maintain direct connections for efficient, low-latency communication.

## Unified Agent & Server Registry

This platform serves as a comprehensive, unified registry supporting:

- ✅ **MCP Server Registration & Discovery** – Register, discover, and manage access to MCP servers
- ✅ **AI Agent Registration & Discovery** – Register agents and enable them to discover other agents
- ✅ **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication** – Direct agent-to-agent communication patterns using the A2A protocol
- ✅ **Multi-Protocol Support** – Support for various agent communication protocols and patterns
- ✅ **Unified Governance** – Single policy and access control system for both agents and servers
- ✅ **Cross-Protocol Agent Discovery** – Agents can discover each other regardless of implementation
- ✅ **Integrated External Registries** – Connect with Anthropic's MCP Registry and other external sources
- ✅ **Agent Cards & Metadata** – Rich metadata for agent capabilities, skills, and authentication schemes

Key distinction: **Unlike separate point solutions, this unified registry eliminates the need to maintain separate MCP server and agent systems**, providing a single control plane for agent orchestration, MCP server access, and agent-to-agent communication.

## A2A Agents - Example Implementations

The registry includes two example A2A agents that demonstrate how both human developers and autonomous AI agents can discover, register, and use agents through the unified Agent Registry. Agents can programmatically discover other agents via semantic search and use them through the A2A protocol, enabling dynamic agent composition and autonomous agent orchestration.

### Example Agents

| Agent | Path | Skills |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Travel Assistant Agent** | `/travel-assistant-agent` | Flight search, pricing checks, recommendations, trip planning |
| **Flight Booking Agent** | `/flight-booking-agent` | Availability checks, flight reservations, payments, reservation management |

### Agent Discovery

**View in Registry UI:**
Open the registry and navigate to the **A2A Agents** tab to browse registered agents with their full metadata, capabilities, and skills.

**Search via CLI:**
Developers can search for agents by natural language description:

```bash
# Search for agents that can help book a trip
cli/agent_mgmt.sh search "need an agent to book a trip"
```

**Example Output:**
```
Found 4 agent(s) matching 'need an agent to book a trip':
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent Name                               | Path                      | Score
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Travel Assistant Agent                   | /travel-assistant-agent   |  0.8610
Flight Booking Agent                     | /flight-booking-agent     |  1.2134
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Agent-to-Agent Discovery API

The registry provides a **semantic search API** that agents can use as a tool to discover other A2A agents at runtime. This API enables dynamic agent composition where agents find collaborators based on capabilities rather than hardcoded references.

**Discovery API Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/agents/discover/semantic?query=<natural-language-query>&max_results=5
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

**Response includes:**
- Agent name, description, and endpoint URL
- Agent card metadata with skills and capabilities
- Relevance score for ranking matches
- Trust level and visibility settings

**How agents use it:**
1. An agent calls the registry's semantic search API with a natural language query (e.g., "agent that can book flights")
2. The registry returns matching agents with their endpoint URLs and full agent card metadata
3. The agent uses the agent card to understand capabilities and invokes the discovered agent via A2A protocol

**Example - Travel Assistant discovering and invoking Flight Booking Agent:**
```
User: "I need to book a flight from NYC to LA"

Travel Assistant:
  1. Calls registry API: POST /api/agents/discover/semantic?query="book flights"
  2. Registry returns Flight Booking Agent with endpoint URL and agent card
  3. Uses agent card to understand capabilities, then sends A2A message to Flight Booking Agent
  4. Returns booking confirmation to user
```

This pattern enables agents to dynamically extend their capabilities by discovering specialized agents for tasks they cannot handle directly.

**Agent Cards:** View the agent card metadata at [agents/a2a/test/](agents/a2a/test/) to see the complete agent definitions including skills, protocols, and capabilities.

For complete agent deployment and testing documentation, see [agents/a2a/README.md](agents/a2a/README.md).

export DOCKERHUB_ORG=mcpgateway
```

**Step 4: Deploy with pre-built images**
Our service can be deployed with two platforms for pre-built images: Docker and Podman. 

**With Docker (default):**
```bash
./build_and_run.sh --prebuilt
```

**With Podman (rootless, macOS (but NOT Apple Silicon) friendly):**
```bash
./build_and_run.sh --prebuilt --podman

# If running on macOS Apple Silicon, remove the --prebuilt flag (more details in Podman option below) 
./build_and_run.sh --podman # For Apple Silicon 
```

> **Port Differences:**
> - **Docker**: Services run on privileged ports (`http://localhost`, `https://localhost`)
> - **Podman**: Services run on non-privileged ports (`http://localhost:8080`, `https://localhost:8443`)
> - All internal service ports remain the same (Registry: 7860, Auth: 8888, etc.)

For detailed information about all Docker images used with `--prebuilt`, see [Pre-built Images Documentation](docs/prebuilt-images.md).

**Step 5: Initialize Keycloak**
Complete: **[Initialize Keycloak Configuration](docs/complete-setup-guide.md#initialize-keycloak-configuration)** - Set up identity provider and security policies

**Step 5.5: Set up users and service accounts**
Run the bootstrap script to create default users and M2M service accounts:
```bash
./cli/bootstrap_user_and_m2m_setup.sh
```

This script:
- Creates 3 Keycloak groups: `registry-users-lob1`, `registry-users-lob2`, `registry-admins`
- Creates 6 users for testing and management:
  - **LOB1**: `lob1-bot` (M2M service account) and `lob1-user` (human user)
  - **LOB2**: `lob2-bot` (M2M service account) and `lob2-user` (human user)
  - **Admin**: `admin-bot` (M2M service account) and `admin-user` (human user)
- Generates and saves OAuth credentials to `.oauth-tokens/` directory

All user passwords default to the value set in your `.env` file (`INITIAL_USER_PASSWORD`).

**Step 6: Access the registry**
```bash
open http://localhost:7860
```

**Step 7: Create your first agent**
Complete: **[Create Your First AI Agent Account](docs/complete-setup-guide.md#create-your-first-ai-agent-account)** - Create agent credentials for testing

**Step 8: Restart auth server to apply new credentials**
```bash
docker-compose down auth-server && docker-compose rm -f auth-server && docker-compose up -d auth-server
```

**Step 9: Test the setup**
Complete: **[Testing with mcp_client.py and agent.py](docs/complete-setup-guide.md#test-with-python-mcp-client)** - Validate your setup works correctly

**Benefits:** No build time • No Node.js required • No frontend compilation • Consistent tested images

### Option B: Podman (Rootless Container Deployment)

**Perfect for macOS and rootless Linux environments**

Podman provides rootless container execution without requiring privileged ports, making it ideal for:
- **macOS** users with Podman Desktop
- **Linux** users preferring rootless containers
- **Development** environments where Docker daemon isn't available

**Quick Podman Setup (macOS non-Apple Silicon):**

```bash
# Install Podman Desktop
brew install podman-desktop
# OR download from: https://podman-desktop.io/
```

Inside Podman Desktop, go to Preferences > Podman Machine and create a new machine with at least 4 CPUs and 8GB RAM. Alternatively, see more detailed [Podman installation guide] (docs/installation.md#podman-installation) for instructions on setting this up on CLI. 

```bash
# Initialize Podman machine
podman machine init
podman machine start

# Verify installation
podman --version
podman compose version

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

**Deploy with Podman** see full Podman setup instructions (downloading, installing, and initializing a first Podman container, as well as troubleshooting) in our [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md#podman-installation).

**Build with Podman:**

```bash
# Auto-detect (will use Podman if Docker not available)
./build_and_run.sh --prebuilt

# Explicit Podman mode (only non-Apple Silicon)
./build_and_run.sh --prebuilt --podman

# Access registry at non-privileged ports
open http://localhost:8080
```

> Note: **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)?** Don't use `--prebuilt` with Podman on ARM64. This will cause a "proxy already running" error. See [Podman on Apple Silicon Guide](docs/podman-apple-silicon.md). 

```bash
# To run on Apple Silicon Macs:
./build_and_run.sh --podman
```

**Key Differences vs. Docker:**
- No root/sudo required
- Works on macOS without privileged port access
- HTTP port: `8080` (instead of `80`)
- HTTPS port: `8443` (instead of `443`)
- All other service ports unchanged

For detailed Podman setup instructions, see [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md#podman-installation) and [macOS Setup Guide](docs/macos-setup-guide.md#podman-deployment).

### Option C: Build from Source

**New to MCP Gateway?** Start with our [Complete Setup Guide](docs/complete-setup-guide.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions from scratch on AWS EC2.

**Running on macOS?** See our [macOS Setup Guide](docs/macos-setup-guide.md) for platform-specific instructions and optimizations.
